- 2/14/2020
  - enlarged plot labels and points for better visibility
  - added chiSqG/chiSqGxE LD clumped results
  
- 3/15/2020
  - additional 2df/3df plots excluding SNPs with any D|G (main effects) association p < 5e-8 (simpler to identify 2df/3df hits driven by GxE or G|E)
  - added meta-analysis of exposure main effect by tumor site (proximal, distal, rectal)
  - added pooled analysis of exposure main effect by tumor site (proximal, distal, rectal)
  - removed chiSqGxE LD clumped results from report
  - generated descriptive tables (e.g. table1) by both outcome and exposure variable (when categorical)

- 3/24/2020
  - fixed labeling error for study-design stratified pooled analysis of E main effects
  - changed order of tumor stratified pooled analysis results table (proximal, distal, rectal)
- 2020/04/10
  - added 3DF plot that excludes D|G and E|G significant loci
